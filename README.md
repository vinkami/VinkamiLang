# VinkamiLang

VinkamiLang is a Paper / Spigot plugin aiming to provide easier and quicker development for your Minecraft server. This language has a similar working principle when compared to [Skript] simply because this project's idea comes from it. However, VinkamiLang has a more structural syntax instead of Skript's natural syntax, making coding for an experienced programmer simpler.

**Please note that this project is still in development and is not ready for production use.**

## Requirements
Supposingly, [Spigot] works, but [Paper] is way more recommended because the plugin is majorly tested on Paper servers.  
To be specific, the plugin is tested on Paper 1.18.2, and the sole developer here doesn't quite have the time to test everything out.
